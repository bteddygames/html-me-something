            The Quick Story of Jay

                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p>Growing up I have always been in the St. Louis area. I was born on January 9th in Centreville, IL and I lived in Cahokia, IL.
                Most of my time was spent playing video games, writing stories, or trying to learn something new.
                I grew up being the youngest out of 5 children and also being the only male with 2 half sisters and 2 full blood sisters.
                We lived in a moderate size house with multiple stories. I grew up having a lot of animals and that is something I still want to have to this day.
                Some of my first systems growing up were the Nintendo Entertaninment System and Sega Genesis.
                These systems would have a great affect on what games I like to play now.</p>

                <h2>School</h2>
                <p>Most of my time spent in school was in Cahokia. There were only 2 years where I wasn't in a Cahokia school and I was in Belleville.
                Once for first grade and again during my freshmen year of high school. I have went to 5 schools during this time and my favorite time was during my freshmen year.
                I graduated from my high school near the top of my class even though I spent most of my school time sleeping. 
                I wasn't the most motivated student nor was the best student. While I was attending middle school, my parents took on their own cleaning business.
                This business I had to help out with so whenever I got out of school a lot of my time was helping them out with their jobs.
                I would get home at random times and was pretty tired most days. This didn't continue past my freshmen year but the bad habits had already set in.
                During my senior year I was accepted into multiple schools including Wash U and MIT.</p>

                <h2>Adult</h2>
                <p>After I left college I started a part time job at The Home Depot where I started off being a cashier and moved onto other departments.
                I was there for 2 years before I left to start another job that would have been in Maryland Heights but it ended up falling through. 
                I tried looking for other positions but wasn't very successful. I had moved out shortly after I started at The Home Depot and I was going to move back with my parents after my lease was up.
                A few months after I moved back a friend helped me out getting me a job as a recruiter in St. Louis. After 6 months of being there I was transferred to a differen loacation to deal with other parts of the company.
                I stayed there for another one and a half years until the job became way more stressful than what I could handle so I left.
                Since I didn't complete college and was in for philosopy along with coding I decided to try out for LaunchCode after hearing how much one of my sisters loved it.
                I put in an application but I'm sure I didn't get in due to me putting it in on the very last day due to anxeity. The next time I heard that they were doing classes I had missed the deadline after hearing about it too late.
                When the April class had been announced I quickly sprung to get in that time around. When LaunchCode delayed the acceptance announcement by a week, due to application rates being way higher than what they expected, my heart started racing fearing that I wouldn't be able to get in again.
                Finally I received the email that let me know that I was accepted and I told myself that I am going to take this as serious as anything before. All of the slacking I did in school and doing the bare minimum just to get by was not going to be applied to this program.
                There is so much respect I have for this program and I wasn't going to let myself take anything for granted.

                <h2>Past and Current Dreams</h2>
                <p>When I was younger, around six, I tried to think what I wanted to be when I got older. My first dream goal was to be a scientist.
                I wanted to study diseases to either cure them or exploit them. For some weird reason I wanted to help people or harm them depending on how I felt about them. It was a weird mix between being a great chemist and a mad scientist.
                I remember there was a time in middle school where they wanted us to dress up as the career path we wanted. I wanted to dress up in a lab coat but my parents couldn't afford one so I decided to dress up as a game designer.
                From there I took that idea and just kept running with it. I started writing stories that could be for small games but I didn't look towards the technical side of it until I got to college. I took some coding classes and enjoyed them.
                The biggest problems I was facing was dealing with some mental issues along with wrapping my head around the logic. I started taking philosophy classes to get my head around the subject. I liked the philosophy classes and I believe it helped my writing even more.
                Due to budget constraints I couldn't keep attending college and that didn't help with my mental issues. The one thing I was enjoying was stripped away. When I heard about LaunchCode I found it to be my second chance in life to help me achieve my dream of being a game designer.
                Going into it I knew that it wasn't going to be specific to game designing but it was going to be a great platform to get my skills to a lever where I can start coding for gaming.
                Before being accepted into LaunchCode I started working with a free software program using Unity's game design software. I was able to make a simple game using a box to glide around a surface and a point tracking system until the trial of Visual Studio ended.
                I knew what I was going to get out of these classes was the skills to write code in a more effective way, structure my code way better, and potentially getting a job coding that way I can move into my desired career path.
                The rest now is up to me to make sure that I can keep everything that I learned retained in my head to finally move in the direction I want to be in.
